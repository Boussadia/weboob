Weboob is a project which provides a core library, backends and applications.

The core library defines capabilities: features common to various websites. For
example, http://www.youtube.com and http://www.dailymotion.com are both videos
providers: Weboob defines the “ICapVideo” capability.

Each backend interfaces a website and implements one or many of these
capabilities. Backends can be configured, which means that the end-user can
provide personal information to access the underlaying website (login/password
for example).

Applications offer the ability to the end-user to work with many backends in
parallel, in a multi-threaded way. For example, one could search a video on
many providers websites. Applications are toolkit-agnostic. They can use Gtk,
Qt or text-only, more adapted to reuse data through pipes.

The core library provides base classes which help the developer to write
backends and applications.

Weboob is written in Python and is distributed under the GPLv3 license.
