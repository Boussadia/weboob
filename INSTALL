Weboob installation
===================

Like any setuptools package, Weboob can be installed in normal mode,
or in development mode.

normal mode
-----------

Install:
# ./setup.py install --record installed_files.txt

The files are simply copied in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Weboob-x.y-py2.5.egg
The --record flag is used to remember which files were copied.

Uninstall:
# cat installed_files.txt | xargs rm -rf

development mode
----------------

The development mode doesn't copy files, but it creates an egg-link
which points to the development directory.
It is useful for development when files often change.

# ./setup.py develop
Creates /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Weboob.egg-link

bash completion
---------------

To enable bash completion, just source the tools/weboob_bash_completion
file from your ~/.bash_completion file (which is sourced by /etc/bash_completion).
