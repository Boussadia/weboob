Weboob installation
===================

Using the packages provided by your distribution is recommended.
See http://weboob.org/install for a list of available packages.

Since there are many dependencies, when you install from sources,
you have to handle them by hand, according to your distribution.

The requirements are provided in ``setup.py``, except for:

* gpgv (for secure updates). If not packaged alone, it should be in ``gnupg`` or ``gpg``.
* PyQt4 (python-qt4) for graphical applications.
* For more performance, ensure you have ``libyaml`` and ``simplejson`` installed.

Some modules may have more dependencies.

All installation procedures allow you to chose whether you want graphical
applications.  Add ``--no-qt --no-xdg`` to disable them; ``--qt --xdg`` to
enable them.

After a package or system installation, you should run ``weboob-config update``
as your login user.

User installation
-----------------

There is a way to install weboob locally without messing with your system.
Run ``./tools/local_install.sh`` as your local user. ::

    $ ./tools/local_install.sh ~/bin

The scripts are copied to ``~/bin``.

System installation (discouraged)
---------------------------------

The install mode copies files to the Python system-wide packages directory (for
example ``/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages`` for Python 2.5, or
``/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages`` for Python 2.6). ::

    # ./setup.py install

Scripts are copied to ``/usr/bin``.

Development mode
----------------

This does not actually install anything, but lets you run Weboob from the
source code, while also using the modules from that source. This is only
recommended if using the git source and not a release. ::

    $ ./tools/local_run.sh APPLICATION COMMANDS

For example, instead of running ``videoob -b youtube search plop``, you would
run::

    $ ./tools/local_run.sh videoob -b youtube search plop


Bash completion
---------------

To enable bash completion, just source the ``tools/weboob_bash_completion``
file from your ``~/.bashrc`` file.
