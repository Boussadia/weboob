Weboob installation
===================

Like any Python package using setuptools, Weboob can be installed in normal or
development mode.

Weboob is distributed with many packages. There is one package for the core
library, many packages for backends (grouped by capabilities), and one package
for each application.


Eggs install
------------

Call the helper script which will build the packages and install them all:

# ./tools/all_packages.sh install

To uninstall:
* remove the Weboob eggs:
# rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/weboob_*.egg
* remove the weboob lines in
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/easy-install.pth


Development mode
----------------

The development mode doesn't copy files, but it creates an egg-link
which points to the development directory.
It is useful for development when files often change.

# ./setup.py develop
Creates /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/weboob_dev.egg-link

To uninstall, remove this egg-link and remove the weboob_dev line in
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/easy-install.pth


Debian note
-----------

When using Debian, it is advised to install Python Debian packages, and not the
PyPI ones (when they are available).

To achieve this, please install the following packages before installing Weboob:
* python-gdata


Bash completion
---------------

To enable bash completion, just source the tools/weboob_bash_completion
file from your ~/.bash_completion file (which is sourced by /etc/bash_completion).
