Weboob installation
===================

Like any Python package using setuptools, Weboob can be installed:
 * from eggs
 * from Debian packages
 * from setup.py in install mode or in development mode


From Eggs
---------

Weboob is distributed using many packages. There is one package for the core
library, many packages for backends (grouped by capabilities), and one package
for each application.

To install:
TODO: no packages released for the moment

To uninstall:
TODO: no packages released for the moment


From Debian packages
--------------------

Install from the Weboob repository:
TODO: no Debian repository exists

For developers: build yourself Debian packages using
$ ./tools/packaging/create_debian_packages.sh


From setup.py
-------------

The install mode copies files to /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages
or /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages

The development mode doesn't copy files, but it creates an egg-link
which points to the development directory.
It is useful for development when files often change.

# ./setup.py develop
Creates /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/weboob_dev.egg-link
or /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/weboob_dev.egg-link

If you don't want to install all the dependencies, use the --no-deps option:
# ./setup.py develop --no-deps
and install dependencies by hand from your distribution packages, or from PyPI
using easy_install, or the more modern pip.

Scripts are copied to /usr/bin.

To uninstall, remove the egg-link and remove the weboob_dev line in
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/easy-install.pth
or /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/easy-install.pth


Bash completion
---------------

To enable bash completion, just source the tools/weboob_bash_completion
file from your ~/.bash_completion file (which is sourced by /etc/bash_completion).
