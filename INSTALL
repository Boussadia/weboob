Weboob installation
===================

Like any Python package using setuptools, Weboob can be installed in install
mode or in development mode.


Install mode
------------

The install mode copies files to the Python system-wide packages directory
(for example /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages for Python 2.5,
or /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages for Python 2.6)

# ./setup.py install

Scripts are copied to /usr/bin.

Since there are many dependencies, when you install from sources,
you have to handle them by hand, according to your distribution.
If you still want to download them, you can uncomment the dependencies
in setup.py

To uninstall, remove the egg-link and remove the weboob_dev line in
your Python system-wide packages directory.


Development mode
----------------

The development mode doesn't copy files, but creates an egg-link
in the Python system-wide packages directory which points to the development
directory. It is useful for development when files often change.

# ./setup.py develop
